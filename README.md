# Recommending Tourist Destination on the basis of their Description

## Overview

Welcome to the Tourist Recommendation Project! This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to recommend tourist destinations based on user input. The recommendation system employs a combination of text preprocessing, feature engineering, and an ensemble model to predict the category of user input, subsequently suggesting relevant places to visit within the predicted category.
The dataset used has 850 description text in english language with their category
